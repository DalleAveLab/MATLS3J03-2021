# MATLS3J03-2021
Github for McMaster's MATLS 3J03 course - used to host Jupyter notebook code examples. To access the notebooks open one of the ipynb (iPython notebook) files. A bit of a disclaimer, the purposes of these tutorials is to illustrate the python syntax for the concepts we learned in class, there may be small bugs/typos in the descriptions here. If there are, please let me know. 

I've noticed that GitHub doesn't support the equation formatting in Markdown. If you want to see the Jupyter Notebooks with formatted equations please download the notebook and open it with the Jupyter notebook tool which you can access from the Anaconda Navigator. To download the notebook, click the "raw" button in the top right of the file then save it (ctrl+s). 

An interactive version of the notebooks (hosted via mybinder) can be found below:

Note that this doesn't require python to be installed so it can be used to explore the code before you're all setup on your own machines. Also note that the link above may lag behind the github version as it takes some time for mybinder to update from git.
